Raju is a Hindu born and brought up in Bengaluru, India. But he does not have any document to prove the citizenship. Will he be given citizenship under CAA?
No he will not. The CAA is not a substitute for lack of documents. He must produce the required documents show he is an Indian. Or he must produce documents to show he is from Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan. Born and brought up in India, if Raju cannot produce documents to prove as an Indian it would only be harder for him to  prove that he is from Pakistan
